# Maze-traversal
### Graph traversal investigation for use in A Level lessons

Idea and graph based on the Maze found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7b7aa0/visualizing_the_depthfirst_search_recursive/)

Currently using Dijkstra's Algorithm, but will be expanded to include breadth & depth first search and A* pathfinding.
