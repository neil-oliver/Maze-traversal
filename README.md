# Maze-traversal
### Graph traversal investigation for use in A Level lessons

Idea and graph based on the Maze found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7b7aa0/visualizing_the_depthfirst_search_recursive/)

Currently using Dijkstra's Algorithm, but will be expanded to include breadth & depth first search and A* pathfinding.

Heuristic search has now been added using a search based on closest linked node.

-----------------------

Imagine that each square of the maze has a grid reference, starting with A1 at the top left, through to Q20 at the bottom right. Each decision point on the graph is given a reference. These are the reference names used to create the graph.
